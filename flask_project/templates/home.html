        <p>The economic foundations of tourism are essentially the cultural assets, the cultural property and the nature of the travel location. The World Heritage Sites are particularly worth mentioning today because they are real tourism magnets. But even a country's current or former form of government can be decisive for tourism. For example, the fascination of the British royal family brings millions of tourists to Great Britain every year and thus the economy around £550 million a year.
            <br><br>
        Italy has more World Heritage sites than any other country.
            <br><br>
            Italy has one of Europe’s longest histories, yet it’s only been a country since 1861. In Roman times Italy was a single entity. It then divided into a collection of sovereigns and remained that way until 1861. This long history of individuality is why the country today has such a wide range of culture variations.

            People have visited Italy for centuries, yet the first to visit the peninsula for tourist reasons were aristocrats during the Grand Tour, beginning in the 17th century, and flourishing in the 18th and the 19th century. This was a period in which European aristocrats, many of whom were British and French, visited parts of Europe, with Italy as a key destination. For Italy, this was to study ancient architecture, local culture and to admire the natural beauties.
